This app id developed by me for WOC 3.0 under the guidance of cyberlabs. This is a simple note taking web application which helps you to create notes, edit them and delete them.
Some features of this app includes:
-Notes can be accessed on any device.
-Notes can be marked as important so that you cannot miss them among the clutter.
-Notes can be created in various colors for different topics.You can later group your notes based on their color.
-Notes can be easily searched with the title or the note content. This makes managing notes even easier.
-Notes can also be edited and replaced by previous one.
